Node properties
- Type:
  - Every node must have a type. (Representation nodes are excluded.)
  - Type names can be overridden by the format. For example, CBOR uses arrays, while ASN.1 uses lists.
- Key:
  - I'm not going to enforce consistency on the type level.
  - If the key is user-provided, then it could potentially be decoded further.
  - If the key is system-provided, then it can't be decoded further.
  - Not everything will have a key.
